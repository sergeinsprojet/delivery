Express shipping with unmanned aerial vehicles ("drones")


Traiding company is looking into express shipping with unmanned aerial vehicles ("drones").

There is a fleet of drones in two locations available:
Metrostrasse 12, 40235 Düsseldorf
Am Albertussee 1, 40549 Düsseldorf

Currently four test customers participate
C1 : Kronprinzenstraße 88, 40217 Düsseldorf
C2 : Kaiserstraße 2, 40479 Düsseldorf
C3 : Wildenbruchstraße 2, 40545 Düsseldorf
C4 : Schlesische Straße 5, 40231 Düsseldorf

Traiding company can supply goods out of these following locations:

Schiessstraße 31, 40549 Düsseldorf
Friedrichstraße 152, 40217 Düsseldorf
Breslauer Str. 2, 41460 Neuss
Bataverstraße 93, 41462 Neuss
Am Sandbach 30, 40878 Ratingen

The process of delivery works like this:
- The orders are pre-picked and can be picked up without delay from the stores above
- The drone will always begin from one of the two drone depots mentioned above
- After picking up the goods the drone will fly to the customers in the shortest distance

Develop highly re-usable Java software that will calculate the fastest delivery from depot to store to customer.
Your software should tell which depot and store shall be chosen for a given customer and calculate the total delivery time in minutes and seconds.

Assumtions: You can pre- calculate the GPS coordinates and use these in your software.
The drone has a velocity of 60 km/h. No time for pick-up and hand-over is required.

Work with programming paradigms that you find appropriate and suitable.
